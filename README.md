# JDAUtils
Utilites for working with the JDA(Java Discord API)

This contains all sorts of useful methods to save time, space and provide better visibility. 

I will add a javadoc at some point.


Some method/features:

Embed Builders for certain colors or any color

Getting a specific message from a channel

Checking if a person has a specific role/list of roles

Removing/Adding roles to members by string, id
